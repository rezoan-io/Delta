# Numerical Integration: Simpson’s Rule vs Trapezoidal Rule (C Implementation)

This project implements **Simpson’s Rule** and **Trapezoidal Rule** in C to approximate definite integrals.  
The results of both methods are compared for accuracy using two example integrals:

1. **Integral 1:** ∫₀^π sin(x) dx  
2. **Integral 2:** ∫₁² ln(x) dx

## 📚 Overview
Numerical integration is used to estimate the area under a curve when the exact integral is difficult or impossible to calculate analytically.  
This project compares **Simpson’s Rule** and **Trapezoidal Rule** to evaluate:
- Accuracy of each method
- Effect of increasing the number of subintervals `n`

## ⚡ Features
- Functions to compute **Trapezoidal Rule** and **Simpson’s Rule**
- Supports any user-defined function
- Demonstrates convergence as `n` increases
- Prints a side-by-side comparison of results
